                    <li><strong>"AgData"</strong> is a division of CropData that manages the entire data life-cycle from collection, analysis to reporting.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Agriota E-Marketplace Facilitation Centre" (AEFC)</strong> is an office facility or an exclusive part of larger office facility, as per the CropData's System where the Franchisee/ Sub-Franchisee onboards Buyers/ Sellers/ Traders
                        and assist them to the buy/ sell products on the Agriota E-Marketplace and guides them during the transaction life-cycle. </li>

                        built on Blockchain Technology and Multi-Tier Escrow Banking Architecture for secured and transparent transaction and money management. It provides detailed verification reports produced through the Dr. Krishi platform for periodic

                        as a distributed ledger, a Blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot
                        be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks. Although Blockchain records are not unalterable, Blockchains are considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine

                                additional band of 25% of the original advance will be required to be serviced/ topped-up by You, which will be deducted from the VAN. The variance calculations will be revised continuously, until contract settlement or
                                until the lot value is equivalent to zero. In the event, value of the lot is above the current value or within the advance served, then the excess advance will not be returned immediately, it will be adjusted against the

                            <li>The advance calculations for the refloat are as per extreme scenarios of quality and quantity as defined in the contract thresholds. The amounts in excess of the extreme scenarios is released to the VAN, the balance is released
                                at the end of the contract, as per the specifications at the time of Contract Settlement.</li>
